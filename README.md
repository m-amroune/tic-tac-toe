# Project : Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## About the Project

**Objective** : Build a Tic-Tac-Toe game using React. The game renders a 3x3 board of clickable squares, alternates turns between X and O, stops interaction once a player has won, includes a reset button, and displays a message for a winner or a draw. The project follows FreeCodeCamp’s front-end certification requirements.

## User Stories

- User Story #1: You should create a Board component that renders nine button elements each with a class of `square` in a 3x3 grid.
- User Story #2: Clicking `button.square` elements should alternate between displaying an `X` then `O` within the element.
- User Story #3: Once a player has won the game, clicking on any `button.square` should not cause any further changes.
- User Story #4: You should create a `button#reset` element that resets the game when clicked.
- User Story #5: A message should be displayed indicating either `X` or `O` as the winner, or neither if the result is a draw.
